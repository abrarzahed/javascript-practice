// BUG:: A common example of an bug because using "var"

if (!products) deleteProductArray();
var products = 10;
function deleteProductArray() {
  console.log('Product are deleted â›”');
}

// POINT: See here products == 10 but still the deleteProductArray function is executed. Because var can be accessed before the are declared. And the initial value was undefined. undefined is a falsy value thats why the deleteProductArray was called and product array was deleted.
